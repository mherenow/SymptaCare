# SymptaCare: Healthcare Chatbot

SymptaCare is a symptom analysis chatbot that helps users understand their health concerns through a conversational interface. The chatbot assesses symptoms, provides basic diagnosis for common ailments, and offers appropriate guidance.

## Key Features:
- Interactive symptom assessment through natural language processing
- Integration with a healthcare API to analyze reported symptoms
- Personalized home remedies and recovery advice for minor ailments
- Intelligent escalation for potentially serious conditions
- Google Maps API integration to suggest nearby healthcare professionals
- User-friendly interface with conversation history

The chatbot distinguishes between minor issues that can be treated at home (like common colds, minor headaches, or indigestion) and more serious conditions requiring professional attention. When serious symptoms are detected, SymptaCare recommends appropriate medical professionals and displays nearby options using location data.

This project combines healthcare knowledge with practical technology solutions to provide accessible health guidance while encouraging proper medical care when needed.
